Because Frotz was originally written specifically for MS/PC DOS and then
ported to Unix machines.  As such, nothing about it was written with
36-bit systems in mind.  The initial job of porting to the PDP-10 mostly
involves taking the differences between 32-bitness and 36-bitness.  This
was sufficient for porting the dumb interface.  The ongoing job of
adding full screen handling will involve coming up with an old version
of curses or writing a cut-down version that supports only VT100/ANSI
and maybe VT52.

Currently the porting effort is focusing on TOPS20.

The porting effort used Mark Crispin's Panda TOPS20 distribution from
http://panda.trailing-edge.com/ and the KCC C compiler which is included.

To compile, do "make tops20".  This will copy the needed source files to
the "snavig/" directory and process them to fit TOPS20's limit of six
alphanumeric caps-insensitive characters on extern symbols and
filenames.  The contents of this directory then needs to be uploaded to
a subdirectory on a PDP10.  Then while in the directory with the source,
the following command will then compile and link the code to produce an
executable:

cc -o dfrotz.exe *.c

There will be some complaints of unused parameters for some functions.
This is to be expected because the usual means of making the compiler to
keep quiet about these things don't work for KCC.  A considerable amount
of disk quota is required to complete the linking, but how much is not
entirely known.
