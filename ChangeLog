Summary of changes between Frotz 2.55 and Frotz 2.55:
=====================================================

Frotz 2.55 is currently in development.

This is a minor release focusing on minor enhancements and bug fixes.

NEW FEATURES

- Updated and cleaned up manual pages.

- Added -L option to xfrotz - supply a Quetzal file to load on command line.

- Added support for the Z-Machine Standard 1.1 save-restore prompt option.

BUG FIXES

- Fixed brain-dead handling of undo slots.

- Fixed a segfault when xfrotz detects a fatal error.

- Fixed compile failure of the SDL interface for GCC 12 and maybe GCC 11.

- Not a bug in Frotz itself, but the BUGS text file was deleted from the
  source repository and tarball before the release of Frotz 2.50.

- Fixed faulty handling of text styles in dumb interface.


Summary of changes between Frotz 2.53 and Frotz 2.54:
=====================================================

Frotz 2.54 was released on Wednesday April 13, 2022.

This release's main attractions are official support for TOPS20 and
cross-compilation to DOS.

NEW FEATURES

- Added changes to allow for compilation on a DEC PDP-10 mainframe
  running TOPS20.  See INSTALL_PDP10.

- Added a means to cross-compile to DOS by way of Open Watcom C version
  2 and later.  See INSTALL_DOS.

- Added a quiet mode to dumb interface to quell startup messages.

BUG FIXES

- Fixed several problems with compilation under macOS.

- Fixed wrong glyphs in DOS Frotz's Amiga font mode.  1/2 and 1/4 were
  there instead of the oe and OE ligatures.

- Fixed a failure of the -q flag to actually silence sound effects.

- Fixed an oversight in SDL Frotz that prevented some sounds from
  playing in Lurking Horror.

- Made the dumb and curses interfaces read the resolution chunk from
  Blorb files.  Previously they would assume a resolution of 320x200.


Summary of changes between Frotz 2.52 and Frotz 2.53:
=====================================================

Frotz 2.53 was released on Saturday February 27, 2021.

This is a minor release focusing on minor enhancements and bug fixes.

NEW FEATURES

- -E option to choose how emphasised text is rendered.

- X11 interface has been added as a compile target.

- Added new default TrueType font for sfrotz.

- Automatically select the appropriate interpreter number for V6 games.

- Limited mouse support for curses interface.

BUG FIXES

- Corrected potential trouble with garbage in filenames for SDL
  interface.

- Corrected a problem wherein @print_table would sometimes print garbage.

- Fixed a segfault problem when input buffers are abused.

- Double-clicks are now recognized in sfrotz and xfrotz.

- Fixed problem with spurious newlines when a space triggers a word wrap.

- Fixed a problem with UTF-8 characters getting corrupted during line
  editing.

- Fixed some problems with V3 games scribbling on the status line in
  certain circumstances.

- Removed C99 idioms and C++ comments in curses and core to benefit
  older compilers.  X11 is still pre-C99 clean.  SDL interface is not
  pre-C99-clean due to libSDL2 not being pre-C99-clean.

- Fixed a problem with the -x flag not properly expanding commands for
  some Infocom games.


Summary of changes between Frotz 2.51 and Frotz 2.52:
=====================================================

Frotz 2.52 was released on Sunday May 10, 2020.

This is a minor release focusing on minor enhancements and bug fixes.

NEW FEATURES

- Partial support for new @set_true_colour opcode.  Works for SDL.
  Doesn't work all the way for curses.  Not in scope for dumb interface.


BUG FIXES

- Reworked Makefiles to better handle library detection, particularly
  for macOS.

- Fixed rendering of non-paletted PNG images.  Affected only non-Infocom
  V6 games.

- Rolled back idiosyncrasy fix for Cutthroats and changed over to the
  quick-and-dirty 24-to-12 conversion used by Infocom as this is how the
  Imps expected an interpreter to behave.

- Fixed broken handling of game paths set in environmental variables and
  in config files.

- Fixed slightly broken parsing of .sfrotzrc.

- Fixed behavior of command line processing inconsistent between the
  different user interfaces.

- Assorted source code formatting fixes.


Summary of changes between Frotz 2.50 and Frotz 2.51:
=====================================================

Frotz 2.51 was released on Wednesday February 12, 2020.

This is a minor release focusing on minor enhancements and bug fixes.

NEW FEATURES

- Added an -f option for Dumb Frotz to mark up the output with color and
  formatting codes.  Currently "irc", "ansi", and "normal" modes are
  supported.


BUG FIXES

- Cleanly account for some installations of ncurses which have the
  library split into ncurses (high level) and tinfo (low level).

- Added an idiosyncrasy fix for Cutthroats, which assumes a
  quick-and-dirty conversion of 24-hour notation to am/pm notation.

- Fixed where the Makefile used spaces instead of a tab in a rarely-used
  recipe.

- Fixed a memory allocation problem with restoring a game at the command
  line using the -L option.

- Fixed an oversight in which curses wasn't being shut down properly
  when fatal zcode errors were encountered.


Summary of changes between Frotz 2.44 and Frotz 2.50:
=====================================================

Frotz 2.50 was released on Tuesday November 12, 2019.

NEW FEATURES

- Added UTF-8 input and output.  Plain ASCII is still available.

- Added -L option for restoring save file directly from the command line.

- Added -R option for restricted read/write path.

- Sound effects in AIFF, MOD, and OGG formats supported per the Blorb specs.

- Sound driver selection is automated through the use of libao.

- Allow for an alternative Blorb file to be specified on the command line.


BUG FIXES

- Overhauled MacOS compilation.

- Corrected problems with error handling.

- Fixed a lot of unsafe strcpy() and strcat() calls.

- Fixed numerous problems with portability to other flavors of Unix.

- Fixed adaptive palette rendering for SDL.

- Fixed scaling with manually specified window dimensions.

- Fixed problem with unnecessary newlines with input timeouts.

- Allow fontdir in .sfrotzrc to work relative to user's home directory.

- Fixed problem with memory allocation leading to crashes in DOS.

- Fixed problem with DOS Frotz creating non-portable Quetzal files.


Summary of changes between Frotz 2.43 and Frotz 2.44:
=====================================================

Frotz 2.44 was released on Sunday May 17, 2015.

NEW FEATURES

- Blorb support implemented.  No support for audio in Blorb files yet.

- Added an -m option for Dumb Frotz to suppress the [MORE] prompt.

- Makefile and code for compiling for 16-bit DOS.

- DOS Frotz now distributed in the same source file as Unix Frotz.


BUG FIXES

- Fixed a problem with saving and restoring in certain games.

- Added some fflush() calls to make Dumb Frotz more suitable for bot use.

- Removed old-style save support.  It was getting hard to manage.  Only
  the Quetzal save file format is supported now.

- Fixed assorted minor 64-bitness problems.

- Makefile cleaned up.


Summary of changes between Unix Frotz 2.42 and Unix Frotz 2.43:
===============================================================

Unix Frotz 2.43 was released on Monday October 28, 2002.

NEW FEATURES

- Dumb interface has been added as a compile target.
  See the DUMB file for commentary.

- Experimental voice input and output.  This code is not yet available
  to the public.  See the SPEECH file for more info.

- Added David Kinder's Unicode Test 1.0 to the Z-machine Test Suite

- Added Inform Randomization Test 1.0 to the Z-machine Test Suite.


ENHANCEMENTS

- Confirmed to work with NetBSD 1.6.x curses library.  Unlike with
  ncurses, color mode will work when $TERM is "xterm".  See the BUGS
  file for commentary.

- Consolidated and organized most global variables into a few global
  structs.

- Added patches from David Kinder to facilitate loading a new game
  without exiting Frotz entirely.  Files affected: buffer.c, process.c,
  and sound.c.

- Rewrote most documentation.  Fixed typos in the rest.

- Reorganized source tree to make portability to different platforms
  easier.  The bugtest/ directory is now src/test/ and is called the
  "Z-machine Test Suite".


BUG FIXES

- Finally changed all references in documentation and source of
  ftp.gmd.de to ftp.ifarchive.org.

- Fixed a problem with command-recording which caused "[999]" to be
  appended to every line in the file.

- Set some defaults to z_sound_effect for those games that for some
  wacky reason assume them (sound.c).

- Frotz now correctly sets 0x20 (CONFIG_SOUND) in the header to tell V6
  games that the interpreter supports sound (frotz.h ux_init.c).

- Correctly fixed the Ctrl-Space bug.  The previous fix broke NetBSD's
  newly-updated curses library.  See the BUGS file for more detail.

- OSS sound is fixed, thanks to Torbjorn Anderson!  Also applied some
  error-checking from someone whom I forget.



Summary of changes between Unix Frotz 2.41 and Unix Frotz 2.42:
===============================================================

Unix Frotz 2.42 was released on Monday March 11, 2002.

NEW FEATURES

- Makefile updated to play nicer with Mac OS X.


BUG FIXES

- Al Petrofsky sent a fix to prevent Frotz from aborting when Ctrl-Space
  is entered (in ux_input.c).  Actually it was sent to Debian's bug list
  several months ago, but not to me.  He also submitted a patch which
  prevents picture dimensions from being rounded down to zero (ux_pic.c).
  Sidebars in Arthur are now visible.

- Steven Frank was mistakenly identified as the submitter of the fix to
  allow Unix Frotz to display properly on screens narrower than 80
  columns.  The true submitter was Justin Wesley.  The machine used was
  an Agenda PDA running Linux.



Summary of changes between Unix Frotz 2.40 and Unix Frotz 2.41:
===============================================================

Unix Frotz 2.41 was released on Monday May 21, 2001.

NEW FEATURES

- Now includes several test zcode programs in the bugtest/ subdirectory.
  These are crashme, TerpEtude, gntests, and strictz.

- Unix Frotz confirmed to compile and run on Mac OS X.  See INSTALL for
  details.
  (Confirmation by Steven Frank)

- Status line padding in screen.c changed to allow for screens narrower
  than 80 columns.
  (Patch by Steven Frank)


BUG FIXES AND MINOR ENHANCEMENTS

- In BUGS, an idiosyncrasy of "Journey" by Infocom was mistakenly
  identified as a bug in Frotz.
  (Reported by someone whom I forget)

- In text.c, static zchar zscii_to_latin1[] was being improperly
  initialized.  The bug caused Latin1-style quotes <<like this>> to look
  >>like this<<.
  (Reported and fixed by Matteo De Luigi)

- In the 2.40 release, I disabled the -i option thinking it wasn't needed.
  This was probably a mistake.  Even if the -Z option is set to '0' (don't
  report errors), fatal errors will still be reported.  Some careless
  programmers have released buggy games which include fatal errors.
  Proper interpreters should abort upon encountering them, but some don't.
  The -i option is intended as a kludge to deal with such games and for
  debugging by ignoring the requirement to abort.  This option should not
  be used as an excuse to write bad code.  Code in object_address() in
  object.c was modified to complain about attempts to address illegal
  objects.  This was motivated by an illegal object access in the game
  "Enemies" by Andy Phillips.
  (Reported by Thomas Troeger and David Picton)



Summary of changes between Unix Frotz 2.32R2 and Unix Frotz 2.40:
=================================================================

Unix Frotz 2.40 was released on Saturday November 11, 2000.

BUG FIXES

- Tab-completion now works in the middle of a sentence.

- Assorted fixes to make gcc stop complaining when using -Wall and -ansi
  flags.  These fixes included adding curly braces to avoid
  ambiguous-looking if-then-elses, adding parens to avoid abiguous-looking
  ands and ors, initializing variables even though there was no need to.

- Several functions in ux_text.c used functions that wanted
  *char.  Instead they were being passed *zchar.  Irix's cc
  complained.  Casts were added to fix this.

- The terminal erase character, as set with stty, now functions as
  backspace.  On many terminals, this character is DEL.

- Background colors should now work properly.

- timeout() from curses is now used for times input instead of a busy
  loop.

- ^L and ^R now redraw the screen instead of being passed as input to the
  Z-machine.

- ISO-Latin-1 characters are now valid input unless in plain ASCII mode.
  This makes the meta bit unusable for hotkeys.  On terminals with 8-bit
  character sets, alt usually sends ESC anyway.

- With zstrict error-checking tuning, the -i (for ignore errors) is
  superfluous and therefore has been removed.

- A supplementary memmove() function has been added for machines that lack
  it.  As I don't have access to a machine like this, the code is
  untested.


NEW FEATURES

- Merged changed from Frotz 2.40 for DOS.

- Beginning with 2.40, the reference version of Frotz (the DOS version) is
 distributed under the GNU Public License rather than the old "no
 commercial profit" license.

- Unix Frotz 2.40, like the reference version, is now distributed under
  the GNU Public License.

- V6 games supported by drawing the outlines of pictures.  True display of
  the graphics are on hold until the X11 with GTK version is complete.

- Classical Infocom sound effects supported through the OSS drivers.  I'm
  only aware of "Lurking Horror" and "Sherlock: The Riddle of the Crown
  Jewels" as having such sound effects.  See the INSTALL file for
  information on where the sound files should go.

- System-wide and per-user config files.

- Quetzal save format is now the default.  Old Zip 2.0 format is still
  supported by command line option or config file setting.

- $ZCODE_PATH and $INFOCOM_PATH environmental variables searched for game
  files.

- Faster undo functionality (borrowed from Nitfol).

- History searches have been added.  Type the beginning of a past command
  and hit the up or down arrow key.
