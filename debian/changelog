frotz (2.40-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.  (Closes:Bug#77358).
  * Moved to "main"; Frotz is now GPLed!
  * Ported old Debian patches to the new release.
  * Default name for saved games now has ".frotz" if Frotz's old save
    format is in use (-Q on command line) or ".sav" if Quetzal is being
    used (the default).
  * Updated to policy version 3.2.1.
  * Removed conflicts against ancient versions of some zcode games.
  * Bumped up frotz's alternatives priority a bit, so that it's definitely
    preferred over jzip.  This should be okay now that frotz is free.
    (Closes:Bug#53430).
  * Comply with the FHS.
  * Built against libncurses5.  (Closes:Bug#69700).

frotz (2.32r2-9) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Move /usr/bin/zcode-interpreter to /usr/games.

frotz (2.32r2-8) frozen unstable; urgency=low

    update the alternatives to match.  Fixed.

 -- Charles Briscoe-Smith <cpbs@debian.org>  Mon,  6 Apr 1998 22:44:15 +0100

frotz (2.32r2-7) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved frotz from /usr/bin to /usr/games.  (Fixes:bug#19730)
    Technically, frotz is a virtual machine interpreter, not a game,
    but most people are likely to look for it in /usr/games first.

frotz (2.32r2-6) unstable; urgency=low
