<p>
Frotz is an interpreter for Infocom games and other Z-machine games.  It
complies with 
<a href="http://www.inform-fiction.org/zmachine/index.html">standard 1.0</a>
of Graham Nelson's specification.  It was written by Stefan Jokisch in
1995-1997.  It was ported to Unix by Galen Hazelwood.  Currently the Unix
port is being developed and maintained by David Griffith.  The Unix port
is also the canonical core version upon which all other ports are based.

interface, an <a href=http://www.libsdl.org/>SDL</a> interface, and a 
dumb interface that requires absolutely no other libraries besides the 
standard C library.

<h2><a name="credits">Credits</a></h2>
<p>
This program started as a remake of Mark Howell's Zip, but has grown into
a completely new interpreter with ports for lots of platforms.

<p> 
Thanks goes to Stefan Jokisch for writing Frotz and Galen Hazelwood for
doing the initial work of porting it to Unix.  Thanks also to Jim Dunleavy
for his optimization to the core Frotz code.  Other people to thank
include those who uploaded patches to Unix Frotz to the IF-Archive and
getting me interested in the inner-workings of interpreters like Frotz,
people who posted to Usenet feedback on what I was doing, testers, those
who donated the use of machines for porting, sent me patches, etc.  These
include, but are not limited to:

<blockquote> 
Torbjorn Anderson, Timo Korvola, Martin Frost, Mihail Milushev, David
Picton, Chris Sullivan, Leonard Richardson, Stephen Kitt, Paul E Coad,
Paul Janzen, Brad Town, Jason C Penney, Denis Hirschfeldt, Jacob Nevins,
Matteo De Luigi, Steven Frank, Thomas Troeger, and others that I've 
forgotten.
</blockquote>

<p>
Michael Edmonson (author of Rezrov) and Evin Robertson (author of Nitfol)
deserve recognition for the ideas that I've borrowed from their
programs.  Al Petrofsky (creator of dumbfrotz) donated much code to allow
Unix Frotz to semi-support V6 games.
