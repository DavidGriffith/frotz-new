In 2019, a Kickstarter campaign was run to raise funds to pay Mark
McCurry to overhaul the audio subsystem in the curses port of Frotz.
I've tried off and on since 2013 to do this, but there was always a
problem with mixing two audio streams and excessive CPU usage.  Mark is
much better at this kind of programming and is well-known for working on
some very good audio-related projects.  However, he would not do the
work for free.  Therefore I started a Kickstarter campaign to pay him.

The audio subsystem now reads and processes audio data through
libsndfile, libmodplug, libsamplerate, libvorbis, and a few other
libraries brought in as dependencies.  Output is throgh the libao
library, which automatically takes care of the messiness of figuring out
exactly how to talk to the audio hardware.

A total of $1,078.00 was raised in 30 days.  After taxes, fees,
backed-out pledges were subtracted, the total sum was $878.60.
